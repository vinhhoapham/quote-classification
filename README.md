# Multi-Label Quote Classification

## Description

This project focuses on developing a model capable of classifying quotes into multiple categories. It leverages a combination of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Attention Mechanism to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of multi-label classification.

## Project Structure

- **Data Folder**: Contains both raw and cleaned datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **DataCrawler**: This directory includes all the necessary code for data crawling. It is designed to work seamlessly with the Scrapy command-line tool for efficient data scraping.
- **Model.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the complete code for training the classification model. It also provides a detailed analysis of the model's performance and results.
- **EDA.ipynb**: This notebook offers an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset, providing insights into its structure and key characteristics.

## Requirements

To run and interact with the project, the following technologies and libraries are required:
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Python
- PyTorch
- Scrapy
